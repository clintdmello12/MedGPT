# MedGPT: Multimodal Large Language Model for Medical Insights

MedGPT is an advanced multimodal system combining the power of Large Language and Vision Models (LLMs) to interpret medical images and clinical text. This system provides ChatGPT-like responses tailored for medical diagnostics by extracting meaningful insights from complex data. It aims to facilitate better interactions between healthcare professionals and medical data, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multimodal Understanding:**
  - Extracts insights from both medical images (e.g., MRIs, X-rays) and clinical text data.
  - Provides ChatGPT-like outputs tailored specifically for medical diagnostics.

- **Sophisticated Model Engineering:**
  - Fine-tuned LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
  - Optimized model performance without losing pre-trained weights.

- **Applications:**
  - Medical image analysis with text-based reporting.
  - Clinical text comprehension and summarization.
  - Assists doctors with diagnostics and medical decision-making.

## Compliance & Data Security (HIPAA & GDPR)

- We take data privacy and protection seriously. MedGPT is designed to be compliant with both HIPAA (for U.S. healthcare data) and GDPR (for EU personal data) standards.

- To support this, the infrastructure code for setting up secure cloud environments on AWS and Azure is being uploaded using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. This includes:

 **What‚Äôs Included:**
	‚Ä¢	Scripts to provision:
	‚Ä¢	Encrypted storage (S3 buckets on AWS, Blob Storage on Azure)
	‚Ä¢	IAM roles with restricted access and MFA
	‚Ä¢	Cloud logging and monitoring (CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Azure Monitor)
	‚Ä¢	Security alerts and threat detection
	‚Ä¢	Step-by-step tutorials for:
	‚Ä¢	De-identifying medical data (e.g., removing DICOM metadata)
	‚Ä¢	Converting images for safe testing
	‚Ä¢	Implementing breach notifications and audit logging
	‚Ä¢	Enforcing access control and logging policies

**Requirements to Use:**
	‚Ä¢	AWS CLI or Azure CLI installed and configured
	‚Ä¢	Terraform or Bicep (for deploying the infrastructure)
	‚Ä¢	Admin access to create IAM roles and policies
	‚Ä¢	Test data must be de-identified before use (DICOM anonymization recommended)
	‚Ä¢	Team member should be assigned to monitor ongoing GDPR complianc
